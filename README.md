# DSCI_601 Code 

The dataset used in this is publically available in the UCI machine learning repository. 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype

There are 5 Files in this -  For each Contextual Bandit Algorithm 

1. Adaptive Greedy -  CMAB_Covtype_AdaptiveGreedy.pynb
2. Eplison Greedy - CMAB_Covtype_EpsilonGreedy.ipynb
3. Explore First - CMAB_Covtype_ExploreFirst.ipynb
4. Seperate Classifiers - CMAB_Covtype_SeparateClassifiers.ipynb
5. Softmax Explorer - CMAB_Covtype_SoftmaxExplorer.ipynb

Each file has to be run indivudually to get the accuracy of that particular contextual bandit model. 

Commnets have added to the first file CMAB_Covtype_AdaptiveGreedy.pynb, as all other files have similar code expcet the bandit algorithm there are no comments added.
